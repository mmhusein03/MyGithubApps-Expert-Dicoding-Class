MyGithubApp is an Android application designed to find people's Github accounts by their name or username. Users can view detailed information about the Github account, mark it as a favorite, or remove it from favorites. The favorited accounts are then stored in a room database. This project was developed using Kotlin and follows the principles of Clean Architecture. It includes features such as code obfuscation to conceal package names, database encryption, Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, navigation component for page transitions, and Continuous Integration with CircleCI. Additionally, Leak Canary has detected no memory leaks in the project.
